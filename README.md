# what is Docker 


Docker is an open source application container engine, developed based on Go programming language and open sourced under the Apache2.0 protocol. It lets businesses create, test, and deploy various applications and parcels software into units called containers, makes it easy to create a lightweight, portable self-sufficient container for any application on a single host.


# Docker Common Use Cases?
Automated packaging and publishing of web applications.
Automated testing and continuous integration, release.
Deploy and tune databases or other background applications in a service-based environment.
Build your own PaaS environment by compiling or extending an existing OpenShift or Cloud Foundry platform from scratch.

What are the advantages of Docker?
Docker enables you to separate your application from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. By taking advantage of Docker’s approach to delivering, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can greatly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Flexible: Even the most complex applications can potentially be containerized. Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.

Immutable: Container images are immutable. Portable: Can be built locally, deployed to the cloud, and run anywhere.

Scalable: Container copies can be added and distributed on-demand.

Stackable: Services can be stacked vertically and instantly.

#What is the difference between Docker and VM? By adding the Hypervisor layer, the virtual machine virtualizes virtual hardware such as network card, memory, and CPU, and then builds a virtual machine on it. Each virtual machine has its own system…
